Android Application: Activity Life Cycle & Basic UI Demonstration
ðŸ“± Overview
This Android application is developed as part of a practical assignment to demonstrate the functions of the Activity Life Cycle and implement Basic UI components. It is intended for beginners to understand how Android activities work and how user interfaces are created using standard UI elements.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand the Activity Life Cycle (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onRestart(), and onDestroy()).
Implement Basic UI Components like:
TextView
Button
EditText
Toast
Log messages
ðŸ›  Features
Lifecycle Logging: All lifecycle methods are overridden and contain Log messages to track the state of the activity.
UI Elements: A simple UI with:
A welcome TextView
An EditText for user input
A Button that displays the input using a Toast
User Interaction: When the button is clicked, the app retrieves the text entered by the user and shows it in a short popup (Toast).
